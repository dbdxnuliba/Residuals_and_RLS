# Plots

The script ```plots.m``` runs all the other plot functions. It should be run after the main routine is completed, and the data saved in the workspace. Pay attention to the name of the variables used in ```plots.m```, otherwise you will not be able to run it: names are coherent with those used in the main routine.
