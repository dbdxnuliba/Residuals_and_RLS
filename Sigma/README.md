# Sigma

This folder is related to the values of the standard deviation in the default and abrupt change case. They refer to:
- penetration of gel (starting in contact, starting above, teleoperated);
- penetration of liver.

They are strongly dependent on the considered data-set. However, one can expect that these values do not change much if the same material is used.
